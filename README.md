Hardhat, a development environment that facilitates building on Ethereum. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps, and it allows you to easily introduce more functionality around this workflow. This means compiling and testing at the very core.

Hardhat also comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code.

In this tutorial we'll guide you through:

Setting up your Node.js environment for Ethereum development
Creating and configuring a Hardhat project
The basics of a Solidity smart contract that implements a token
Writing automated tests for your contract using Hardhat
Debugging Solidity with console.log() using Hardhat Network
Deploying your contract to Hardhat Network and Ethereum testnets
